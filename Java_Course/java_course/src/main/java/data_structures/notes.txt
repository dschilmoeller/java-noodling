Collections
    common types:
        Set
            unordered collection of unique object.
            e.g. Deck of cards - 52 unique cards.
        List
            ordered elements accessible by position; can contain duplicates.
            e.g. Call History - in order, can have duplicates.
        Queue
            ordered elements that are processed in the order in which they are added.
            useful when <doing a thing> to a list on FIFO principles, e.g. dealing with a line.
        Map
            unordered unique key-value pairs.
            Does NOT inherit from the collection interface.
            Similar enough to be generally included in collections.
            Iterator not available - use entrySet() - see demo.

iterators are one way to loop through Set/List/Queue; part of collection framework so Map does not have direct access to it. See map demo for more info.
see setDemo, mapDemo();

Enhanced for loop - see listDemo(), mapDemo();
Note this is where the List<String> and such begins.

forEach() -
    available on every collection, & Maps!
    currently preferred method (maybe. Might be dated at this point)
