Stream API:
Data Source => Stream Operations => Output
Allows performing operations and receiving output on data without affecting the original data.

e.g.
int[] numbers = {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10};

Arrays.stream(numbers)
    .forEach(n-> System.out.print(n+1 + " "));
    // output: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
sout(numbers) // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

Arrays.stream(numbers).parallel()
    .forEach(n-> System.out.print(n + 1 + " "));
    // output {1, 7, 3, 11, 5, 9}
    // likely to be different each time.

Stream operations:
Intermediate -> Perform operation and return resultant stream
Terminal -> return a result & close the stream
